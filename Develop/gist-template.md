# Title (replace with your title)

Regex101 is a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression AKA regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

## Summary
I will be describing "Matching a Hex Value" The code snippet is the following: 
 /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

## Table of Contents

- [Anchors](#anchors)
The anchors on the code snippet <strong> ^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$ </strong> are: `^` and `$` <br>
The '^' is called The cadet, and the cadet symbol at the beginning of a regular expression denotes the start of a line or string. It is used as an anchor to specify that the pattern that follows should match at the start of the line or string. <br>
The '$' is called... you guessed it! Its called The dollar sign, and the dollar sign at the end of the regular expression denotes the end of a line or a string. It is used as an anchor to specify that the pattern that precedes should match at the end of the line or string. 

- [Quantifiers](#quantifiers)
The quantifiers on the code snippet <strong> ^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$ </strong> are: `{6}` and `{3}` <br>
The `{6}` is applying to the character class `[a-f0-9]` which matches hexadecimal characters and it's specifying that the preceding pattern `[a-f0-9]` must occur exactly six times. <br>
Similarly, the `{3}` is also applying to the character `[a-f0-9]` and it's specifying

- [Grouping and Capturing](#grouping-and-capturing)
The  on the code snippet <strong> ^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$ </strong> are: ` ` and ` ` <br>

- [Boundaries](#boundaries)
The  on the code snippet <strong> ^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$ </strong> are: ` ` and ` ` <br>


- [Back-references](#back-references)
The  on the code snippet <strong> ^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$ </strong> are: ` ` and ` ` <br>


- [Look-ahead and Look-behind](#look-ahead-and-look-behind)
