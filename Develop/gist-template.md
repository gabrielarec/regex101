# Title (replace with your title)

Regex101 is a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression AKA regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

## Summary
I will be describing "Matching a Hex Value" The code snippet is the following 
 /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

## Table of Contents

- [Anchors](#anchors)
The anchors on the code snippet ^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$ are: '^' and '$'. 
The '^' is called The cadet, and the cadet symbol at the beginning of a regular expression denotes the start of a line or string. It is used as an anchor to specify that the pattern that follows should match at the start of the line or string. 
The '$' is called... you guessed it! Its called The dollar sign, and the dollar sign at the end of the regular expression denotes the end of a line or a string. It is used as an anchor to specify that the pattern that precedes should match at the end of the line or string.
